# üí´ About Me:
My name is Casey and I have 3 years of experience in finance. 3 years in equity and 1 year in fixed-income. I have 1 year of professional experience in  software engineer. Python and C++ are my strongest languages but I also know JavaScript. With coding, I am experienced in Financial Modelling, data retrieval and analysis, data structure and algorithms, and Object Oriented Programming. <br><br><br>Recently, I have been investing my time heavily dealing with data. I have been developing a software that parses financial information from 10-K and 10-Q from EDGAR, to create a standardized database for investors to perform popular and custom valuation calculations, using programming languages such as Python and JavaScript, while using version control through GitHub. This is giving me a first-hand experience on how to manage and analyse the data being used both in the financial and technology fields.<br><br>I'm currently learning some frontend languages such as Svelte and backend language such as Golang.<br><br>On my free time, I love to play football (or soccer), ski, hike, or any kind of sports!
